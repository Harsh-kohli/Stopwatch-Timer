Hi All,

This project uses vanilla javascript for creating a beautiful responsive Stopwatch,

This project enabled the user to enter a time in minutes and display it in the form of a timer with visualised wheel running as the time decreasing.

Feel free to fork the timer and connect if you can improve anything, I will be happy to make improvements to this project.

Thanks for reaching!
